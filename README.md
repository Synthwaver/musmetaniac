# Musmetaniac

The project is designed to display tags for recently listened tracks from [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm).

## Known issues

Now it often happens that no tags are displayed for a track. There are problems with database synchronization on the Last.fm side, and the Last.fm API may return an empty list of tags for the track. Unfortunately they cannot say when this will be fixed. But you can always click the `View on Last.fm` link and check tags there.
